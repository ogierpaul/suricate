# Suricate
A simple and effective framework for finding duplicate entities between datasets. It also draws heavily on fuzzy matching, using both tf-idf and python-levenshtein (fuzzywuzzy) package.
Based on a modular architecture using Pandas and Scikit-learn base classes (transformer), it is completely customizable and pipelineable.

## Aim: Using machine learning to find duplicate records
### Examples
Duplicate records, or record matching, may occur in different environments:
- Merging two systems of informations (ex: two ERP systems), where you need to identify which supplier companies are the same
- Finding a person between two databases (ex: online survey with email vs windows login)
- ...

The aim is to compare a dataframe (target) with another (right)
- create a similarity matrix between the two set of records
- label the data as 0 --> not a match and 1 --> match
- train a Classifier on the data
- predict

## Project Structure
* suricate: python package
    * contains the code with the base class to do the deduplication
* tests:
    * test library for the suricate package (in progress)
* tutorial:
    * Jupyter Notebooks to guide how to use the suricate package
